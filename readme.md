# First Republic Take Home

Note: Look above at `app.py` for all the code used to answer questions.  

### 1) How many employees submitted ideas?
Answer: 102 unique employees submitted ideas.  
I used username as that is likely, but not guaranteed, to account for duplicate employee names. 

### 2) How many ideas were submitted in 2018?
Answer: 128 ideas (or 84.2% of all ideas in the dataset) were submitted in 2018.  

### 3) Create a pie chart that shows the breakout of all ideas by department of person submitting the idea.

### 4) Of the ideas that were implemented, which two departments benefited most?
Answer: Production with 8 implemented ideas, and Human Resources with 7 Implemented Ideas.

### 5) Powerpoint slide:
Talking points
- The Ratio% represents how many ideas benefited each department divided by the number submitted by
the department.  Departments can submit ideas to other departments so this gives an idea of who is 
benefiting vs who is coming up with the ideas. 
- The Production Department submitted the most ideas, but only 8 ideas were implemented.  
this resulted in the lowest implemented/submitted ratio.  
- HR submitted the 2nd least number of ideas, but the ratio shows they benefited more on a percent
basis than any other department.  This indicates that other departments are submitting ideas that
are implemented on the HR team.  This can be indicative that every team interacts with HR to handle
newhires, benefits, payroll, etc... and could be taking an active step to improve processes within HR.
